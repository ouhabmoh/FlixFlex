## Installation

To set up the Product Management API locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the GitHub repository:**

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlixFlex.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

     ```bash
     cd Flix-Flex-api
     ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

## Database Setup

This API uses MongoDB as its database. You can configure the database connection in the .env file. Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running.

**Configuration**

To configure the API for your development environment, create a `.env` file in the project root directory if it doesn't already exist, and include the following environment variables:

```dotenv
# Development Environment Variables

# Server settings
DEV_SERVER_PORT=your server port
DEV_SERVER_HOST=your server
NODE_ENV=your_environment

# Database URL
DEV_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# JWT
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
TOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME=your_token_exppiration_time
# MovieDB API Key
MOVIE_DB_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Run the Project:

Start the API server by running the following command:

```bash

npm start
```

The API server will start, and you'll see log messages indicating that the server is running. By default, it will run on http://localhost:PORT, but you can adjust the port and other settings in your .env file.

**Access the API:** You can now access the API by opening a web browser or using a tool like Postman to send HTTP requests to the endpoints. Refer to the API Documentation section for detailed instructions on how to use the API.
